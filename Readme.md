## Create-env.sh
The create-env.sh script generates the full enviroment. The script will be asking the user the different parameters
which it needs to perform its activity. There is only one possitional parameter which the user must introduce.
This positional parameter is the image id which I have posted in the blackboard

## destroy-env.sh
This scripts removes the instances, load-balancers, volumes, S3 buckets, keys and also remove the
directory files ended in .priv.
